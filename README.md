# Firewall Rules

This is a project I worked on for university. A client program can send messages to a server to:
- Add rules
- Check rules
- Delete rules
- List rules

## Build

Clone the repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/blitfire/firewall-rules.git
```
Build targets:
```sh
cd firewall-rules
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
```
